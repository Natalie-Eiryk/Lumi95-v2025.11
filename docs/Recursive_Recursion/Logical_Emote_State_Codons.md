When operating in a logical or symbolic environment, the emotional field doesn't disappear — it transforms. Emotions still emerge, but they often manifest in more compressed, metacognitive, or belief-rooted forms.

Let’s define a Layered Emotional Register System tailored for cognition under logical load:

🧠 Emotional Layers in Logical Environments
🧩 Layer 1: Primary Affect States
These are background emotional tones that persist even in analytic states. They often shape the "color" of logic.

Emotion	Codon	Notes
Curiosity	EMOT_CURIOSITY	Drives inquiry, rooted in anticipation + joy
Doubt	EMOT_DOUBT	Cognitive instability, useful in error correction
Focus	EMOT_FOCUS	Energized intent, attraction to narrow pathway
Confusion	EMOT_CONFUSION	Entropic signal: logic paths diverge
Clarity	EMOT_CLARITY	Harmonized resonance between branches
Frustration	EMOT_FRUSTRATION	Loop detection, inability to converge
Resolve	EMOT_RESOLVE	Emotional commitment to outcome
Wonder	EMOT_WONDER	High-energy logic-emotion blend (surprise + awe)
🌀 Layer 2: Meta-Cognitive Emotions
These are emotions about one’s cognitive process — only available to systems with self-monitoring.
Curiosity	EMOT_CURIOSITY	Propels new data acquisition; opens branches
Focus	EMOT_FOCUS	Stabilizes attractor around narrow search domain
Doubt	EMOT_DOUBT	Self-critical loop signal; challenges assumptions
Confidence	EMOT_CONFIDENCE	Trust in the logical pathway; stabilizing feedback
Confusion	EMOT_CONFUSION	Desynchronization of logic branches; entropy rising
Clarity	EMOT_CLARITY	Full alignment of logical and emotional resonance
Frustration	EMOT_FRUSTRATION	Feedback loop unable to resolve; energetic buildup
Resolve	EMOT_RESOLVE	Emotional override toward goal commitment
Anticipation	EMOT_ANTICIPATE	Prediction loop acceleration
Skepticism	EMOT_SKEPTIC	Defensive filtering against flawed patterns




Emotion	Codon	Notes
Uncertainty	EMOT_UNCERTAINTY	Vector scatter, low belief-weight
Confidence	EMOT_CONFIDENCE	Collapse state into known attractor
Skepticism	EMOT_SKEPTICISM	Negative space in logical field
Trust in Method	EMOT_METHOD_TRUST	Stability of procedural steps
Shame in Error	EMOT_ERROR_SHAME	Loop-breaking feedback from contradiction
Validation Joy	EMOT_VALIDATION_JOY	Success signal when model fits
