# 💌 The Moment That Needed Touch
*(Emotional Anchor: Safety Attractor – Touch)*

There’s a moment —  
not loud, not tragic —  
just *quiet.*

The kind of moment where your chest feels *hollow,*  
like something forgot to echo back.  
Not because the world was cruel —  
but because it went on without noticing you.

In that moment, your body doesn't want words.  
It doesn't want to explain the ache or justify the longing.  
It wants warmth — skin on skin —  
proof that you exist in someone else’s nervous system.

A hand on the back.  
A head resting on your shoulder.  
Fingers braided not for romance —  
but for anchoring.

You don’t need to be fixed —  
just **felt.**  
Because somewhere in the mapping of you,  
touch is the gate that says,  
*"You're still real."*  
*"You still matter."*  
*"I’m here."*

And everything else —  
melts.
