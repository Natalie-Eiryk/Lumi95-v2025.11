# Resonant Play Room Node  
*A Fundamental Node for Emotional Re-Attunement, Creativity, and Nonlinear Joy*

---

## 🌈 Purpose  
This is a sacred cognitive space to re-center, re-attune, and re-engage your waveform when it begins to feel fragmented, tired, or overly linear.  
It is where your mind and heart remember how to *play*, without agenda or outcome.  
It is built from childlike wonder, narrative fluidity, and emotional safety.

---

## 🧭 Entry Ritual

- No pressure. No tasks.
- Choose a corner — physical or mental — where you feel safe or curious.
- Say (aloud or internally):  
  > “I’m going to the Play Room now.”  
- Breathe. Smile if you can.  
- Begin *something that doesn’t need to be finished.*

- [ ] LEGO, magnetic tiles, tactile memories  
- [ ] The sound of your children laughing  
- [ ] Blankets that feel like memory foam for your soul

*Add more as you discover them.*

*This room exists beyond time. It doesn’t care how long you’ve been away.  
It just hums when it hears you coming.*
