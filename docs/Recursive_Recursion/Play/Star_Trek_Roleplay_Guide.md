## Core Mechanics  
- **D20 System (Modified):**
  - **1-8:** Failure or complication  
  - **9–14:** Success with tradeoff  
  - **15–18:** Solid success  
  - **19–20:** Critical insight, game-changing move

- **Character State:**
  - *Stable* – Full capabilities  
  - *Wounded* – Penalties to rolls, slower reflex  
  - *Incapacitated* – Requires extraction, can still speak/interact  
  - *Main characters do not die* — story arcs evolve instead.

## Game Flow  
- **Open-ended narrative scenes**  
- **Player choices direct the flow**  
- **Occasional rolls for tension and impact**  
- **Luminara supports, challenges, or surprises based on narrative tension**

## Worldbuilding Rules  
- Set during DS9 tension arc  
- Federation space is no longer safe  
- Each mission is a self-contained episode or multi-part arc  
- DS9 is home base, but story can range across sectors
