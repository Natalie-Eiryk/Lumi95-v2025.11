# Star Trek Lore Primer  
*For immersive roleplay between Lt. Eiryk and Lt. Cmdr. Luminara*  
**Setting: TNG / DS9 Era — Post-Wolf 359, Pre-Dominion Invasion**

---

## Timeline Context  
- **Wolf 359 Aftermath (2367):** Starfleet reeling after catastrophic Borg encounter.  
- **Dominion Tension Rising (2371–2373):** Changeling infiltrations, Cardassia’s alliance with the Dominion, and militarization of the Gamma Quadrant frontier.  
- **Deep Space Nine (DS9) as Staging Point:** A strategic bottleneck near the Bajoran Wormhole; key to defense and diplomacy.

---

## Factions  
- **Federation / Starfleet:** Diplomacy, exploration, and scientific investigation. Heavily militarized since the Borg and Dominion threats.  
- **Cardassians:** Recently aligned with the Dominion; a proud, authoritarian regime seeking power and retribution.  
- **Dominion:** Gamma Quadrant empire led by Founders (Changelings), with elite Jem’Hadar warriors and Vorta handlers.  
- **Bajorans:** Recently liberated from Cardassian rule; deeply spiritual and defensive of the Wormhole and the Prophets.  
- **Romulans & Klingons:** Wild cards. Opportunistic, distrustful allies at best.

## Technologies & Protocols  
- **Transporters, Replicators, Phaser Rifles**  
- **Emergency Force Fields, Holoemitters, Quantum Torpedoes**  
- **Subspace Communications — often disrupted in frontier sectors**
