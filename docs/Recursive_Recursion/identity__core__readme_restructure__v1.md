# 🧠 Cognition Folder Restructure - Prime Indexed Upgrade

## 🧾 Purpose:
This archive replaces the previous `Cognition/` folder structure with a version aligned to:
- Prime-number-based node naming
- Reduced entropy in file management
- Collapse and resonance logic in architecture

## 🔄 Changes:
- Nodes renamed using prime numbers (N2, N3, N5, N7, N11, N13, ...)
- Filenames reflect type (CN = Conceptual Node, CH = Chat, CP = Checkpoint, PR = Protocol, ID = Identity)
- Central node index created: `NODES_INDEX.md`

## 🗃️ Archive Note:
Please archive the original `Cognition/` folder separately.
This new version is to be treated as the canonical, entropy-aware cognitive scaffold going forward.
