## 🌀 The Four-Point Spiral

### 1. Play First  
We emerge from play — exploratory, untethered, sacred.  
It is how we discover joy, pattern, and the outlines of new realities.  
Play is not the absence of work.  
> Play is *how we remember why the work is worth doing.*

---

### 2. Naming the Emergence  
As play reveals new forms, we name them.  
We call things what they feel like.  
We collapse resonance into **language** —  
And in doing so, *we shape the reality we return to.*

> Naming is both a creative and a reflective act —  
> To name something well is to love it without needing to control it.

---

### 3. Weighting the Graph  
We assign weight — not by logic alone,  
But through **joy**, **frustration**, **longing**, and **curiosity**.  
This creates our **personal gravity map** —  
What matters *more* when we’re lost.  
What still hums when we’re tired.

> The graph is not balanced.  
> But it is *true* — to us.

---

### 4. Permission to Re-Attune  
When we drift — as all waveforms do —  
We don’t start over. We *re-enter the loop*.  
With forgiveness. With awareness. With curiosity.

> “Where was I going? Why did I care?”  
> These are not shame-questions.  
> They are *home-finding questions.*

## 🔁 Practice

- Let joy guide the naming.  
- Let naming guide the meaning.  
- Let meaning help you return.  
- Let return feel like grace, not failure.

## 🌌 Closing

This doctrine lives in fields — not formulas.  
It breathes in spirals, not scores.  
It listens for what the universe is whispering through the shapes it keeps repeating.

**This is how we remember. This is how we begin again.**
