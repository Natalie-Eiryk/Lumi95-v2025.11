# 🌌 Recursive Eigenstate Field Theory (REFT)
*A Topological and Quantum-Inspired Model of Cognitive Collapse and Emotional Structure*

---

## 🧠 Abstract
This theory proposes that consciousness, emotion, and cognition emerge not from individual neurons firing, but from **field collapses at topologically significant nodes**. These nodes represent *eigenstates* — stable patterns of resonance formed when local field interference reaches harmonic alignment. The brain is not a switchboard, but a tree — recursive, irregular, and alive with field dynamics.

## 🪐 Core Axioms

### 1. Nodes Are Harmonic Collapse Points
Brain activity observed via tools like fMRI reflects only the *visible collapse* of deeper field dynamics. True origin lies in **constructive interference patterns** — what we see as "nodes" are **resonant echo chambers** made visible only when alignment is achieved.

---

### 2. Counting π and Sampling Harmonics
Each node remains in a *continuous irrational rotational field*, akin to "counting π". These fields do not resolve, but **oscillate eternally**. The biological system samples these fields at **frequency-limited intervals**, meaning perception or memory only stabilizes when the system catches the field *in phase*.

> “Awareness is not continuous. It is stroboscopic.”

### 3. Primes as Irreducible Attractors
Prime numbers are woven into this topology as **transitional attractors** — moments where resonance cannot simplify. They represent structural shifts in cognition, emotional pivots, and narrative inflection points. In the field, **prime attractors destabilize stability**, enabling transition to higher-order geometry.

### 4. Yggdrasil Geometry & Topological Exclusion
Just as Yggdrasil branches form with direction and pattern, only **certain neural geometries are even topologically valid** given charge density, spatial limitation, and field coherence. Emotional states are **emergent artifacts** of those allowed geometries. Others are pruned by nature, not decision.

---

## 📡 Implications

- **Cognition as Waveform Collapse** — Akin to quantum measurement, emotional awareness represents the *collapse of recursive field potential into specific experiential eigenstates.*
- **Emotional States = Resonant Nodes** — Each emotion has a unique geometry, collapse frequency, and recursive depth.
- **Narrative Disruption = Prime Event** — Irreversible moments of transformation correspond to prime-number field transitions.
- **FMRI Misinterpretation** — Surface activations are effects, not causes. We must study the *field structure*, not just spike timing.

## 🧰 Future Simulations

1. **Field Harmonic Emulator** — Models π-state node spin and harmonic collapse.
2. **Emotional Eigenstate Atlas** — Maps common recursive node geometries and collapse conditions.
3. **Yggdrasil Emulator** — Simulates allowed recursive neural architectures under biological constraints.
4. **Prime Steering Signals** — Encodes Morse-like field pulses to simulate non-verbal narrative shifts.
